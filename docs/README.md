- We use draw.io for drawing ERD(db schema) and UML
  - link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio
- We will not convert UML(or ERD) to code, so don't care about detail. We will use uml for communication.
- There are a lot of UML, but we need only 3. Use only 3 uml for communication.
